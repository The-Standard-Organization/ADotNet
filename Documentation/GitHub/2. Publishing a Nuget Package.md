# 2. Publishing a Nuget Package

Automated publishing of NuGet packages within your release process brings forth a multitude of benefits. 
By automating the publishing step, you not only save valuable time but also significantly reduce the 
likelihood of human errors. The process becomes seamlessly streamlined and consistently reliable, guaranteeing 
immediate availability of the latest version of your software library or package. Through automated NuGet 
package publishing, you unlock the potential for heightened efficiency, enhanced collaboration, and an overall 
more robust software release process.

To implement the automated publish process described, we can add an extra step named "under" under the "jobs" 
section in our GitHub Action. This step will perfom the publish step under the following conditions: 
- It needs the **"add_tag" job to be run**.
- The outcome of the "add_tag" job MUST have succeeded**

Lets have a look at how this can be achieved by adding the following code:

```csharp
var githubPipeline = new GithubPipeline
{
    . . .

    Jobs = new Jobs
    {
        Build = new BuildJob
        {
            . . .
        },
        AddTag = new TagJob
        {
            . . .
        },
        Publish = new PublishJob
        {
            RunsOn = BuildMachines.UbuntuLatest,
            Needs = new string[] { "add_tag" },

            If =
                "needs.add_tag.result == 'success'",

            Steps = new List<GithubTask> {
                new CheckoutTaskV3
                {
                    Name = "Check out"
                },

                new SetupDotNetTaskV3
                {
                    Name = "Setup .Net",

                    TargetDotNetVersion = new TargetDotNetVersionV3
                    {
                        DotNetVersion = "7.0.201"
                    }
                },

                new RestoreTask
                {
                    Name = "Restore"
                },

                new DotNetBuildTask
                {
                    Name = "Build",
                    Run = "dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release"
                },

                new PackTask
                {
                    Name = "Pack NuGet Package",
                    Run = "dotnet pack --configuration Release --include-symbols"
                },

                new NugetPushTask
                {
                    Name = "Push NuGet Package",
                }
            },
        }
    }
};
```


**yaml output for the above code**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # ... your existing build job

  add_tag:
    # ... your existing add_tag job

  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
    - add_tag
    if: needs.add_tag.result == 'success'
    steps:
    - name: Check out
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup .Net
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: 7.0.201
    - name: Restore
      run: dotnet restore
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release
    - name: Pack NuGet Package
      run: dotnet pack --configuration Release --include-symbols
    - name: Push NuGet Package
      run: dotnet nuget push **/bin/Release/**/*.nupkg --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --api-key ${{ secrets.NUGET_ACCESS }} --skip-duplicate
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what each section of the code does:

1. **runs-on: ubuntu-latest**: Specifies that the workflow should run on the latest version of the Ubuntu operating system.

2. **needs: add_tag**: Defines a dependency on the add_tag job. This means that the publish workflow will only run if the 
add_tag job has completed successfully.

3. **if: needs.add_tag.result == 'success'**: Conditional statement that checks the result of the add_tag job. 
If it is successful, the subsequent steps in the publish workflow will be executed.

4. **actions/checkout@v3**: Checks out the source code repository onto the runner machine. This step allows subsequent 
steps to access and manipulate the source code.

5. **actions/setup-dotnet@v3**: Sets up the .NET environment on the runner machine. Specifically, it installs the specified 
version of .NET (7.0.201 in this case) to ensure the required runtime is available for the following steps.

6. **dotnet restore**: Restores the NuGet packages required by the project. This command retrieves and installs the 
necessary dependencies for the project based on the information in the project's .csproj file.

7. **dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release**: Builds the project without restoring the NuGet packages again. 
The --configuration Release option indicates that the project should be built in the Release configuration.

8. **dotnet pack --configuration Release --include-symbols**: Creates a NuGet package from the project. 
The --include-symbols flag indicates that debug symbols should be included in the package. Debug symbols can be useful for debugging purposes.

9. **dotnet nuget push \*\*/bin/Release/\*\*/*.nupkg --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json --api-key ${{ secrets.NUGET_ACCESS }} --skip-duplicate**: 
Pushes the created NuGet package to a NuGet package repository. The \*\*/bin/Release/\*\*/*.nupkg pattern specifies the 
path to the generated NuGet package. The --source option specifies the URL of the package repository. 
The --api-key option references a secret named NUGET_ACCESS that contains the API key for authentication. 
The --skip-duplicate flag prevents pushing packages that already exist in the repository.

    **IMPORTANT** - See the steps below on how to create a NuGet API key and storing it as a repository secret named `NUGET_ACCESS`.


## 2.1. Creating a NuGet API Key


To create a fine-grained personal access token on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

To generate an API key for a package on NuGet, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to the NuGet website**: Go to the NuGet website (https://www.nuget.org) and sign in using your Microsoft account or create a new account if you don't have one.

2. **Navigate to your account settings**: Once you're signed in, click on your username in the top-right corner and select "Account" from the dropdown menu. This will take you to your account settings page.

3. **Generate an API key**: On the account settings page, scroll down to the "API Keys" section. Click on the "Create" button to generate a new API key.

4. **Enter a description: In the "Description" field, enter a name or description for your API key. This will help you identify the key later if you have multiple keys.

5. **Choose the desired permissions**: NuGet allows you to define the permissions for your API key. You can choose from a range of options such as reading, publishing, or deleting packages. Select the appropriate permissions based on your requirements.

6. **Save the API key**: Once you've chosen the permissions, click on the "Create" button to generate the API key. The key will be displayed on the account settings page. Make sure to copy and securely store the key because it will not be displayed again.

7. **Navigate to your repository**: On the GitHub website, go to the main page of the repository where you want to store the token.

8. **Access repository settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab located near the top-right corner of the repository page.

9. **Go to Secrets**: In the left sidebar of the settings page, click on "Secrets" to manage the repository's secrets.

10. **Create a new secret**: Under the Secrets tab, click on the "New repository secret" button.

11. **Provide a secret name**: Enter a name for your secret. It is recommended to use a descriptive name that reflects 
the purpose of the token. For example, you could use a name like `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_TAGGING` or `FINE_GRAINED_TOKEN_TAGGING`

12. **Add the token value**: Paste the fine-grained access token you generated earlier into the "Value" field.

13. **Save the secret**: Click on the "Add secret" or "Save" button to store the secret in your repository.

14. **Access the secret in your workflow**: To use the stored secret in your GitHub Actions workflow or other scripts, 
you can refer to it using the secrets context. For example, you can access the token value with `secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` 
if you named your secret `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

By storing the API key as a secret, you can securely access it within your repository's workflows without exposing 
sensitive information.  It is important to note that secrets are encrypted and cannot be viewed directly by anyone, 
including repository collaborators.  They can only be accessed programmatically within the context of a workflow or action.

That's it! Remember to follow best practices for managing secrets, such as restricting access to the repository, 
regularly reviewing and rotating api keys.
